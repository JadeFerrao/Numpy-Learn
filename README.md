Introduction to NumPy

NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python, is a library in Python that provides support for arrays, matrices, and a large number of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. NumPy is the foundation for many other libraries in Python, such as pandas, SciPy, and scikit-learn.

Installation

To get started with NumPy, you need to install it. You can use pip, the Python package manager, to install NumPy:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy
